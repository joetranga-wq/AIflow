# Studio Design Notes

This document contains non-normative notes about the AIFLOW Studio UI.

## Goals

- Make decision logic visible
- Make routing explicit
- Make traces understandable

## Non-goals

- The Studio is not a low-code automation builder
- The Studio does not execute real actions

The Studio is an editor and debugger for decision flows.
