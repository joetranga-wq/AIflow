## Monday – Debugging & Traces

**Tweet (short)**

Debugging multi-agent AI shouldn’t be guesswork. With AIFlow you get full traces and visual routing for your flows. #AIFlow

AIFlow makes multi-agent debugging visible. Trace every step, see each agent decision and control routing with a powerful condition engine. Build AI systems you can actually reason about. Try AIFlow on GitHub.

Multi-agent systems are powerful, but without proper observability they quickly become a black box.

AIFlow focuses on making these systems debuggable: visual graphs, rich traces and explicit routing logic. You can follow each agent decision, understand failures and iterate with confidence.

If you’re building complex AI workflows, explore the AIFlow repo on GitHub and see how we approach debugging and orchestration.

## Tuesday – Product & Features

**Tweet (short)**

AIFlow Studio lets you design multi-agent workflows visually. Drag, drop, connect agents and conditions, then run them with the CLI runtime.

**Tweet (medium)**

AIFlow Studio is your visual workspace for multi-agent workflows. Design flows, define routing, and combine agents with tools in a clear graph. No more guessing how your architecture fits together. Explore the examples on GitHub and see how it works.

**LinkedIn**

Designing multi-agent workflows doesn’t have to be chaotic.

With AIFlow Studio you get a visual editor that lets you connect agents, tools and conditions into a clear graph. Combined with the CLI runtime and trace viewer, this gives you an end-to-end environment for building and understanding your AI systems.

Check out the AIFlow project on GitHub, explore the included examples and start experimenting with your own flows.
